I passed the PMP certification in May after three months of focused study (February to May). Here's what worked.

## Background

I had 4+ years as an Operations Manager before studying for the PMP, so I already understood project management in practice. The exam was about learning the framework and the PM mindset.

## What I Used

**Andrew Ramdayal's Course**
This was my main learning resource. Clear explanations, practical examples, good pacing.

**PMBOK Guide**
The official PMI book. Dense but necessary for understanding the framework properly.

**PMI Official Course**
Required for eligibility. Useful but not enough on its own.

**Practice Exams**
This made the difference. Daily practice questions helped me understand the PM mindset—how PMI wants you to think about problems.

## My Study Schedule

**Daily: 1-2 hours**
- 30 min: Video course
- 30 min: Practice questions
- Review wrong answers, understand why

**Weekly: Review + longer practice tests**

**Total: 3 months** (February to May)

## What Actually Helped

**1. Practice Tests Daily**
Not just to memorize answers—to learn how PMI thinks. The questions teach you the mindset.

**2. Consistent Daily Schedule**
Better than cramming. 1-2 hours every day beats 8 hours on weekends.

**3. Understanding PM Mindset**
This was the biggest shift. It's not about what you'd do as a project manager—it's about what the PMI framework says you should do. Those are different things.

## What I Wish I'd Known

**The PM mindset matters more than memorizing processes.**

I spent too much time memorizing formulas and process groups early on. The exam tests whether you think like PMI thinks. Practice questions teach you that faster than reading the PMBOK.

**Operations experience helps—but can also trip you up.**

Real-world PM work doesn't always match PMI's ideal framework. You have to learn to answer questions the "PMI way," not the "what I'd actually do" way.

## Study Tools

I built a simple Notion template to track my study sessions, practice test scores, and notes. It kept me consistent and showed progress over the three months.

Includes:
- Daily study tracker
- Practice test score log
- Resources list
- PM mindset notes
- Weekly review structure

## Bottom Line

**Three months. Daily practice. Focus on mindset, not just memorization.**

If you have PM experience already, the PMP is doable in 3 months with consistent study. Practice questions every day. Learn how PMI thinks. Stay consistent.

You've got this.
