This review of *Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee* explores the emotional weight, historical significance, and why every history-lover should read it (even when it hurts).


## First, a Warning: This Book Hurts

If you're looking for a feel-good, underdog-wins-in-the-end kind of history book — *Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee* is not that. At all.

It's the kind of book that makes your chest ache. It should. And if it doesn't? Read it again. Slower.

Published in 1970 by **Dee Brown**, this landmark text shifts the historical narrative westward, far away from the colonial "pioneers" and toward the Indigenous nations whose lands, rights, and lives were systematically taken during the so-called expansion of the American frontier.

## What the Book Actually Covers

This is not one of those vague "Native American history" overviews. Brown structures the book chronologically, tribe by tribe, region by region, showing exactly how the U.S. government broke promise after promise through lies, manipulation, massacres, and forced removals.

Each chapter centers real people: **Sitting Bull. Red Cloud. Geronimo. Cochise. Chief Joseph.**

It's not just what happened. It's *how* it was recorded, distorted, and forgotten until Brown flipped the lens.

## Why It's So Damn Important

This book reframes American history from the perspective of those most devastated by its myth. It's one thing to vaguely know that "bad stuff happened" during westward expansion. It's another thing entirely to sit with the testimony, betrayal, and grief that defined generation after generation of Indigenous resistance.

If you've ever thought, "We weren't taught this in school," you're not wrong. This book fills that silence and then some.

And yet, it's not written like a dry textbook. Brown, who was a librarian by trade, writes with clarity, structure, and empathy. The result? A book that's readable, powerful, and unforgettable.

## A Note on Emotional Toll

Reading this book is heavy. It's repetitive in the worst way. It's definitely not because Brown lacks range. But the U.S. government kept repeating the same crimes.

Treaty made → treaty broken → violence → displacement → rinse and repeat.

It's not a flaw in the book. It's a reflection of historical reality. But pacing yourself while reading? Highly recommended.

## Who This Book Is For

- Writers and researchers interested in power, empire, and narrative control
- Readers who want to fill the historical gaps we were never taught in school
- Anyone ready to confront the uncomfortable truths behind "manifest destiny"

It's not easy. But it's essential.

## What I'm Still Thinking About

This quote:

> "What white man can say I ever stole his land or a penny of his money? Yet they say I am a thief." — Sitting Bull

There are hundreds more. That one just stuck in my throat.

History is not neutral. The way we tell it and who we center in that telling is everything. That's what makes *Bury My Heart* not just a book, but a reckoning.

## Final Take: A Book That Should Ruin Your Day (In the Best Way)

This isn't casual reading. It's commitment reading. It's conscience-level reading. And it's the kind of history that leaves you different than when you started.

Should you read it? If you care about truth, land, justice, and the voices that history tried to erase — then yes. Immediately.
