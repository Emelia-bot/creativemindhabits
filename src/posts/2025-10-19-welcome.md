Welcome to Creative Mind Habits.

This is a space for people who think too much, feel deeply, and build things anyway.

## What This Is

Creative Mind Habits is about turning messy creative process into useful systems. It's for writers, self-directed learners, and anyone who wants to create with intention in the algorithm age.

## What You'll Find

- Simple creative systems (Notion dashboards, prompts, templates)
- Essays on burnout, voice, and creative rhythm
- Tools that make writing more human
- Real projects shared in progress

## The Philosophy

- **Progress over polish** - Ship before it's perfect
- **Share from the middle** - Document the messy bits
- **Build slowly, intentionally** - Sustainable pace, no burnout
- **Rest > rush** - Because creativity needs space

This is just the beginning. More to come.

Thanks for being here.
