It's been a month since the last post, and I've been building more than writing. Here's what's been happening.

## What I've Been Building

**Classroom Management Web App**

This has been the main project. Started it last month and it's been slowly taking shape—tracking student behavior, organizing seating charts, and more. It's not done, but it's working. Still tweaking it, still using it daily.

**Ugly Draft Mode**

I finished and shipped the web editor I mentioned before. It's a writing tool that hides what you've written so you can just keep going without editing yourself into paralysis. 

**This Blog**

You're reading this on my self-hosted site now. Moved off Wordpress, built it with Eleventy, have full control over everything. It feels good to own the space where my work lives.

**My Reading Library**

Just put together my reading list for the next few months. There's something satisfying about having a stack of books waiting like setting up the studio for the work ahead.

## What I've Been Reading

Picked up *Inside Coca-Cola* by Neville Isdell. It's a business memoir about operations, turnarounds, and decision-making at scale. I forgot how much I enjoy reading about systems and operations—the pace, the problem-solving, the satisfaction of completing something concrete.


## What's Next

More building, probably. The classroom web tool is finally wrapping. I want to read more maybe something fiction next, maybe another operations book. And I need to write more consistently here lol.

Talk soon
