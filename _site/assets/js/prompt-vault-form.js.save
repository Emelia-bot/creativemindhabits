Then test again. Let me know what happens!RetryEsame issueLet's try a 
different approach - maybe the nano paste is corrupting the file. 
Let's use VS Code instead:
In VS Code:

Navigate to src/assets/js/
Delete prompt-vault-form.js if it exists
Right-click on the js folder ‚Üí New File ‚Üí name it 
prompt-vault-form.js
Open the new file
Paste this clean version:

javascriptconst form = document.getElementById('cmhEmailForm');
const successMessage = document.getElementById('cmhSuccessMessage');

if (form) {
    form.addEventListener('submit', async function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();

Now we need to convert 3-5 of your best posts from Blogger to 
Markdown and add them to your 11ty site.
Question: Which posts do you want to migrate?
You can either:

Give me the Blogger URLs of your top 3-5 posts, and I'll help convert 
them
Tell me the topics/titles, and I'll help you find and convert them

<p>Yep. That‚Äôs what this edition is about.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre surrounded by more content than ever. But instead of feeling 
informed, we often feel overloaded. Scrolling replaces studying. 
Liking replaces understanding. And somewhere along the way, 
<strong>reading became skimming‚Ä¶ and thinking became 
reacting</strong>.</p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt a lecture. It‚Äôs a soft spiral. A digital reality check 
I needed‚Äîand maybe you do too.</p>
<hr>
<h3>üì≤ What Skim Culture Looks Like</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reading headlines like they‚Äôre full articles</li>
<li>Bookmarking essays we‚Äôll ‚Äúget back to‚Äù (we won‚Äôt)</li>
<li>Reposting without reading</li>
<li>Scrolling past nuance because we‚Äôre tired</li>
</ul>
<p>We skim captions. We skim conversations. We even skim emotions 
sometimes.</p>
<p>And the weird part? It‚Äôs not because we‚Äôre lazy‚Äîit‚Äôs because we‚Äôre 
overwhelmed.</p>
<hr>
<h3>ü§ñ AI Made It Easier. Also Trickier.</h3>
<p>Tools like ChatGPT help us summarize and clarify. But they also 
encourage shortcut thinking. Three bullet points and a nice tone? We 
call it ‚Äúdepth.‚Äù But is it really?</p>
<p>AI can simplify. It can‚Äôt synthesize meaning for you. That‚Äôs still 
on us.</p>
<hr>
<h3>üß† Seeming Smart ‚â† Thinking Deep</h3>
<p>You‚Äôve seen it too, right? The beautifully worded paragraph that 
says... almost nothing? The quote everyone reposts, even though no 
one‚Äôs quite sure what it means?</p>
<p>We sound fluent. But we‚Äôre not always slowing down to <em>actually 
think</em>.</p>
<p>Noticing that doesn‚Äôt make you a cynic. It makes you 
conscious.</p>

<h3>üõ†Ô∏è 3 Gentle Ways to Reclaim Your Brain</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>1. Pick one thing to read all the way through this 
week.</strong><br>No multitasking. No tab-switching. Just read. 
Fully.</li>
<li><strong>2. Summarize a big idea in your own words.</strong><br>If 
you can‚Äôt explain it simply, maybe you don‚Äôt understand it yet. 
That‚Äôs okay‚Äîdig in.</li>
<li><strong>3. Question the vibe.</strong><br>Does this post sound 
smart‚Ä¶ or <em>actually</em> say something?</li>

üéâ Step 2 Complete!
You've now migrated all 5 of your best blog posts to your 11ty site!
When you refresh your browser at http://localhost:8081/, you should 
see all 5 posts on your homepage along with the welcome post.
Ready for Step 3: Deploy to Vercel? This is the exciting part where 
your site goes live on the internet!
Let me know when you're ready and I'll walk you through:

Pushing to GitHub
Connecting to Vercel
Auto-deploying your site

Are you ready to deploy? üöÄRetryEyes let's goooooüöÄ LET'S DEPLOY THIS 
THING!

Step 3: Deploy to Vercel
Part A: Push to GitHub
First, we need to get your code on GitHub so Vercel can deploy it.
1. Create a new repository on GitHub:

Go to https://github.com/new
Repository name: creativemindhabits
Make it Public (so Vercel free tier works)
DO NOT check "Add a README file"
Click Create repository

2. In your Mac Terminal, initialize git and push:
bashcd ~/creativemindhabits
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - 11ty migration complete"
3. Connect to GitHub:
GitHub will show you commands on the page. Copy the lines that look 
like this (but with YOUR username):
bashgit remote add origin 
https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/creativemindhabits.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Paste those commands into Terminal and press Enter.
You might be asked to authenticate with GitHub - just follow the 
prompts.
Let me know when your code is pushed to GitHub! Then we'll connect it 
to Vercel.RetryEokay so i tried to authenticate with password but it 
says it failedGitHub doesn't accept passwords anymore for command 
line access. You need to use a Personal Access Token instead.
Create a GitHub Personal Access Token
1. Go to GitHub Settings:

Click your profile picture (top right) ‚Üí Settings
Scroll down to Developer settings (bottom of left sidebar)
Click Personal access tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic)
Click Generate new token ‚Üí Generate new token (classic)

2. Configure the token:

Note: 11ty deployment
Expiration: 90 days (or your preference)
Check these scopes:

‚úÖ repo (all of them)


Scroll down and click Generate token

3. COPY THE TOKEN IMMEDIATELY!

GitHub shows it only once
Save it somewhere safe (you'll need it in a moment)

4. Try pushing again:
In Terminal:
bashgit push -u origin main
When it asks for your password, paste the token (not your GitHub 
password).
Let me know if this works! If you're still having issues, we can try 
a different authentication method.RetryEmaybe username is wrong?Good 
catch! Let's check. When Terminal asks for credentials, it wants:
Username: Your GitHub username (not your email)
Password: The Personal Access Token you just created

Find Your GitHub Username

Go to https://github.com
Click your profile picture (top right)
Your username is shown there (it's what appears in your profile URL: 
github.com/YOUR-USERNAME)


Try the push command again:
bashgit push -u origin main
When prompted:

Username: Enter your actual GitHub username
Password: Paste the Personal Access Token

What happens now? Does it work, or do you get a different 
error?RetryEyeah same errorLet's try a different approach. We'll use 
SSH instead of HTTPS, which is often more reliable.
Switch to SSH Authentication
1. Check if you have an SSH key:
bashls -al ~/.ssh
Do you see files like id_rsa and id_rsa.pub or id_ed25519 and 
id_ed25519.pub?
If YES: Skip to step 3
If NO or "No such file or directory": Continue to step 2
2. Create a new SSH key:
bashssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
(Replace with your actual email)
Press Enter 3 times (accept defaults, no passphrase for simplicity)
3. Copy your SSH key:
bashcat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
This will print your public key. Copy the entire output (starts with 
ssh-ed25519).
4. Add the key to GitHub:

Go to https://github.com/settings/keys
Click New SSH key
Title: Mac Terminal
Paste your key
Click Add SSH key

5. Change your remote to SSH:
bashcd ~/creativemindhabits
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin 
git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/creativemindhabits.git
git push -u origin main
(Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
Try this and let me know what happens!RetryEwhat if nothing happened 
when I enter cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pubIf nothing appeared, it means 
the SSH key wasn't created. Let's create it now.
Run this command:
bashssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
```

(Replace `your-email@example.com` with your actual email address)

**You'll see prompts - here's what to do:**

1. `Enter file in which to save the key` ‚Üí Just press **Enter** 
(accept default)
2. `Enter passphrase` ‚Üí Just press **Enter** (leave it empty)
3. `Enter same passphrase again` ‚Üí Press **Enter** again

You should see something like:
```
Your identification has been saved in /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Then run this again:
bashcat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Now you should see the key! Copy everything that appears (it will 
start with ssh-ed25519).
Let me know what you see!RetryEso i enter the first line with my 
email address but nothing happens just this: >¬†
>Ah! The > prompt means the terminal is waiting for you to close a 
quote. You probably have an unmatched quotation mark.
Press Control + C to cancel and start over.
Then try again, making sure the email is in quotes:
bashssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "youremail@example.com"
Make sure:

The opening quote " comes right after -C 
The closing quote " comes after your email
No extra quotes or characters

Try that and let me know what happens!RetryEokay i typed it now into 
the terminal but get this Too many arguments.

Just replace hello@creativemindhabits.com with your actual email 
address, keeping the quotes.
Make sure:

The email is wrapped in quotes "
No extra spaces or characters

Paste it, change the email, press Enter, then press Enter 3 more 
times for the prompts.
What happens?RetryEnothing happenes just >You still have an unclosed 
quote somewhere. Let's clear this and try a simpler approach.
1. Press Control + C to cancel
2. Let's skip the email entirely:
bashssh-keygen -t ed25519
Just type that exactly and press Enter.
Then press Enter three times when it asks questions.
What happens now?RetryEstill >You're stuck in a multi-line input. 
Let's get out of it:
Press Control + C multiple times until you see your normal prompt 
again (should look like username@macbook ~ % or similar).
Then close Terminal completely:

Press Command + Q to quit Terminal

Open Terminal fresh:

Press Command + Space
Type "Terminal"
Press Enter

Now try this simple command:

What do you see now?RetryEwhat if it starts with shaPerfect! That's

bashssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

And press Enter.

You should see:
```
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/.../.ssh/id_ed25519):
Just press Enter (3 times total) to accept all defaults.
What do you see?RetryEthe key finger print is..... and a code 
starting with sha... then the keys random art isüéâ Perfect! The SSH 
key was created successfully!
Now let's get the key so we can add it to GitHub.
Run this command:
bashcat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
This will display your public key. It should be a long string 
starting with ssh-ed25519.
Copy the ENTIRE output (select it all and press Command + C).
Then:

Go to https://github.com/settings/keys
Click New SSH key
Title: Mac Terminal
Paste your key in the "Key" field
Click Add SSH key

Let me know when you've added it to GitHub!RetryEokay doneExcellent! 
Now let's connect your repo using SSH and push your code.
In Terminal, run these commands:
bashcd ~/creativemindhabits
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin 
git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/creativemindhabits.git
(Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
Then push:
bashgit push -u origin main
You might see a message asking "Are you sure you want to continue 
connecting?" - type yes and press Enter.
What happens?RetryEi get this The authenticity of host 'github.com 
(20.200.245.247)' can't be established.Perfect! That's normal for the 
first time connecting to GitHub via SSH.
Type yes and press Enter.
This adds GitHub to your list of trusted hosts. You'll only see this 
once.
What happens after you type yes?RetryE[new branch]¬† ¬† ¬† main -> main
branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.üéâ YES! Your code is now 
on GitHub!

Part B: Deploy to Vercel
Now let's get your site live on the internet!
1. Go to https://vercel.com

Click Sign Up (or Log In if you have an account)
Choose Continue with GitHub
Authorize Vercel to access your GitHub

2. Once logged in:

Click Add New ‚Üí Project
You should see your creativemindhabits repository
Click Import next to it

3. Configure the project:

Framework Preset: Should auto-detect as "Other" or "11ty" (either is 
fine)
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: _site
Click Deploy

Vercel will now build and deploy your site! This takes about 1-2 
minutes.
Let me know when you see "Congratulations" or when the deployment 
finishes! üöÄRetryEInvalid request: framework should be equal to one 
of the allowed values "blitzjs, nextjs, gatsby, remix, react-router, 
astro, hexo, eleventy, docusaurus-2, docusaurus, preact, 
solidstart-1, solidstart, dojo, ember, vue, scully, ionic-angular, 
angular, polymer, svelte, sveltekit, sveltekit-1, ionic-react, 
create-react-app, gridsome, umijs, sapper, saber, stencil, nuxtjs, 
redwoodjs, hugo, jekyll, brunch, middleman, zola, hydrogen, vite, 
vitepress, vuepress, parcel, fastapi, flask, fasthtml, sanity-v3, 
sanity, storybook, nitro, hono, express, h3, nestjs, xmcp, ".Ah! 
Vercel needs you to select "eleventy" as the framework.
On the configuration page:

Find Framework Preset dropdown
Select "eleventy" (or "Eleventy") from the list
The other settings should auto-fill:

Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: _site


Click Deploy

What happens now?RetryEmaybe it needs environment variablesNo 
environment variables needed for your site! Your site is just static 
HTML/CSS/JS.
Just leave the "Environment Variables" section empty and click 
Deploy.
Vercel will now build your site. You'll see a build log with 
progress.
What's happening on screen? Do you see the build starting?RetryEso i 
think it didnt't deply itsays no production deploymentThat's okay! 
Let's check what's happening.
Look for a "Deployments" tab or "Visit" button on the Vercel 
dashboard.
Or try this:

Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
Click on your creativemindhabits project
Do you see any deployments listed?
What's the status? (Building, Ready, Error?)

What do you see on your Vercel dashboard?RetryEYour Production Domain 
is not serving traffic.... and info under deployments tabGood! The 
deployment is there. Click on the deployment under the "Deployments" 
tab to see what happened.
Click on the most recent deployment (should be at the top of the 
list).
This will show you:

Build logs
Whether it succeeded or failed
Any error messages

What do you see? Is there a status like "Building", "Ready", 
"Failed", or "Error"?RetryEoh sorry i mean no info under the 
deployments tab just emptyThat's strange! Let's try manually 
triggering a deployment.
Try this:

On your Vercel project page, look for a "Redeploy" or "Deploy" button
Or go to the Settings tab ‚Üí Git section
Make sure your GitHub repository is connected

Or let's force a new deployment by making a small change:
In your Terminal:
bashcd ~/creativemindhabits
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger Vercel deployment"
git push
This pushes an empty commit that should trigger Vercel to deploy.
Wait a minute, then refresh your Vercel dashboard. Do you see a 
deployment now?RetryEso im srill getting this error after force 
deploy The vercel.json schema validation failed with the following 
message: framework should be equal to one of the allowed values 
"blitzjs, nextjs, gatsby, remix, react-router, astro, hexo, eleventy, 
docusaurus-2, docusaurus, preact, solidstart-1, soliAh! The issue is 
in your vercel.json file. Let's fix it.
In VS Code:

Open vercel.json (it's in the root of your project)
Find the line with "framework"
Change whatever value is there to "eleventy"

It should look like:
json{
  "framework": "eleventy",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "_site"
}
Save the file.
Then push the fix:
bashcd ~/creativemindhabits
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Fix framework setting"
git push
Now check Vercel again - does the deployment start?RetryEokay 
deployed!üéâüéâüéâ YOUR SITE IS LIVE!!!
Vercel should show you a URL like creativemindhabits.vercel.app or 
similar.
Click the "Visit" button or copy the URL and open it in your browser!
Does your site load? Can you see your homepage, custom pages, and 
blog posts?

Once you confirm it's working, we have one final step: Connect your 
custom domain (creativemindhabits.com)!
Is the site working? üöÄRetryEyup it's working1  but Blog
* About
* Tools give us 404 not foundAh! The navigation links need to be 
updated. They're still pointing to the old Blogger URLs.
Let's fix the navigation in your site header.
In VS Code:

Open src/_includes/layouts/base.njk
Find the <nav> section (should have links like Blog, About, Tools)
Update the links to:

html<nav>
  <a href="/">Home</a>
  <a href="/about/">About</a>
  <a href="/tools/">Tools</a>
  <a href="/creator-systems/">Creator Systems</a>
  <a href="/prompt-vault/">Prompt Vault</a>
  <a href="/novel/">Novel</a>
</nav>
Save the file.
Then push:
bashcd ~/creativemindhabits
git add .
git commit -m "Fix navigation links"
git push
Vercel will auto-deploy (takes about 1 minute). Then refresh your 
site and the nav should work!
Let me know when you've pushed it!RetryEokay this is the nav section: 
  <nav class="site-nav">
          <ul>
            <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></li>
            <li><a href="/pages/about/">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="/pages/tools/">Tools</a></li>
          </ul>
        </nav>Perfect! I see the issue. The links have /pages/ in 
them, but your pages are at the root level (like /about/, not 
/pages/about/).
Update the nav to this:
html<nav class="site-nav">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about/">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="/tools/">Tools</a></li>
    <li><a href="/creator-systems/">Creator Systems</a></li>
    <li><a href="/prompt-vault/">Prompt Vault</a></li>
    <li><a href="/novel/">Novel</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
Save, then push:
bashcd ~/creativemindhabits
git add src/_includes/layouts/base.njk
git commit -m "Fix navigation URLs"
git push
Wait about a minute for Vercel to deploy, then refresh your site. The 
nav links should work!
Let me know when it's deployed!RetryEokay deployed and work, but 
prompt vault page looks very weird:The Prompt Vault page lost its 
styling because we used inline styles in the Markdown, but they're 
being stripped out or not rendering properly.
Let's simplify the page to use your site's existing design system 
instead of custom inline styles.
In VS Code, open src/pages/prompt-vault.md and replace ALL the 
content with this cleaner version:

## The Idea

Creative Mind Habits began as a notebook with too many tabs open. 
Today it's a small ecosystem (part blog, part studio, part archive) 
documenting how to create with intention in the algorithm age.

I explore systems, storytelling, and reflection‚Äîthen share what 
actually helps others find focus, rhythm, and voice.

<div style="height: 2rem;"></div>

## What You'll Find

- **Simple creative systems** (Notion dashboards, prompts, templates) 
to support momentum, not pressure.
- **Essays & spiral logs** on burnout, voice, and rebuilding your 
creative rhythm.
- **Tools & labs** that make writing and thinking more human, not 
just optimized.
- **Language-learning notes** and other maker journeys shared in 
progress.

<div style="height: 2rem;"></div>

## If You're Here, You Probably‚Ä¶

- Have twenty tabs open but still chase clarity.
- Write to understand yourself (and the world).
- Believe growth is messy but worth documenting.
- Want systems that feel like *support*, not surveillance.

Much better breathing room now! Sections have clear 
separation.RetryEokay great!üéâ Awesome! Your site is looking great!

Final Step: Connect Your Custom Domain
Right now your site is at creativemindhabits.vercel.app. Let's 
connect it to creativemindhabits.com!
In Vercel:

Go to your project dashboard
Click Settings ‚Üí Domains
Add your domain: creativemindhabits.com
Also add: www.creativemindhabits.com
Vercel will show you DNS records to add

Then update your DNS (wherever your domain is registered):
You'll need to add these records (Vercel will show you the exact 
values):

A Record for @ pointing to Vercel's IP
CNAME Record for www pointing to cname.vercel-dns.com

Where is your domain registered? (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, 
etc.)
Once you add the DNS records, it can take a few minutes to a few 
hours to propagate, then your site will be live at 
creativemindhabits.com!
Want to do this now, or are you good to stop here for today? 
üöÄRetryEokay before i do this, how will it affect my current blogger 
siteGreat question! Here's what will happen:
Impact on Your Blogger Site
When you point your domain to Vercel:

creativemindhabits.com will show your NEW 11ty site (on Vercel)
Your OLD Blogger site will still exist at 
creativemindhabits.blogspot.com
All your old Blogger posts will still be there - they just won't be 
at the custom domain anymore

What This Means
‚úÖ Your old content is safe - nothing gets deleted from Blogger
‚úÖ Old links to creativemindhabits.blogspot.com will still work
‚ùå Old links to creativemindhabits.com/old-post will break (they'll 
404 unless you've migrated those posts)
The Good News
You've already migrated your 5 best posts to the new site! So your 
most important content is already on the new 11ty site.
Should You Connect the Domain Now?
Option A: Connect it now - your new clean site goes live immediately
Option B: Wait and migrate more posts first, then connect the domain
What would you prefer? Since you only migrated 5 posts and Blogger 
probably has more, you might get some 404s for posts you haven't 
migrated yet.RetryEhow does the 404 affect my rankinhGood SEO 
thinking! Here's the impact:
How 404s Affect SEO
Short term (first few weeks):

Google will try to crawl your old URLs and find 404s
This can hurt rankings for those specific pages
You might see a temporary drop in search traffic

Long term:

Google eventually removes 404 pages from search results
Your site's overall domain authority isn't permanently damaged
But you lose the SEO value of those old posts

Better Approach: Set Up Redirects
Instead of letting posts 404, you have options:
Option 1: Keep Blogger for now

Don't connect the domain yet
Migrate more posts first (maybe 10-15 key posts?)
Then switch the domain

Option 2: Redirect old posts to relevant new content

Create a redirect map in Vercel
Old post URLs redirect to similar new content or homepage
Preserves some SEO value

Option 3: Create a "catch-all" page

Any 404 shows a helpful page saying "This content moved to our new 
site, browse here..."
Not ideal for SEO but better than blank 404s

My Recommendation
Don't connect the domain today. Instead:

Keep your current Blogger site live for now
Build out more content on the 11ty site (maybe 10-15 more posts)
Then switch the domain with proper redirects

Does that make sense? Want to stop here and migrate more posts later 
before going live?RetryEI think let's connect the domainAlright, 
let's do it! üöÄ
Step 4: Connect Your Custom Domain
1. In Vercel:

Go to your creativemindhabits project
Click Settings ‚Üí Domains
Enter creativemindhabits.com and click Add
Also add www.creativemindhabits.com and click Add

Vercel will show you DNS records that look something like:
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.21.21 (example IP)

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
2. Where is your domain registered?

GoDaddy?
Namecheap?
Google Domains?
Somewhere else?

Let me know and I'll walk you through updating the DNS records there!
What do you see in Vercel after adding the domains?RetryEokay 
namecheapPerfect! Let's update your DNS in Namecheap.
Update DNS in Namecheap
1. Log into Namecheap:

Go to namecheap.com and log in
Go to Domain List
Click Manage next to creativemindhabits.com

2. Go to Advanced DNS:

Click the Advanced DNS tab

3. Delete old records (if any):

Look for any existing A Records or CNAME Records pointing to Blogger
Delete them (you can take a screenshot first as backup)

4. Add Vercel's DNS records:
First, what records is Vercel showing you?
Look in Vercel under Settings ‚Üí Domains. It should show something 
like:
A Record: @ ‚Üí [some IP address]
CNAME: www ‚Üí cname.vercel-dns.com
Tell me what Vercel is showing you, and I'll help you add them 
correctly to Namecheap!RetryEand i see dns records and vercel dns for 
both creativemindhabits.com and www.creativemindhabits.comPerfect! 
Now let's add those to Namecheap.
In Namecheap (Advanced DNS tab):
1. Add the A Record:

Click Add New Record
Type: A Record
Host: @
Value: 76.76.21.21 (use the IP Vercel shows you)
TTL: Automatic
Click the green checkmark ‚úì

2. Add the CNAME Record:

Click Add New Record
Type: CNAME Record
Host: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL: Automatic
Click the green checkmark ‚úì

3. Save all changes

Important: DNS propagation can take 5 minutes to 48 hours (usually 
15-30 minutes).
Back in Vercel, refresh the Domains page after a few minutes. The 
domains should change from "Invalid Configuration" to a checkmark ‚úì 
when they're working.
Let me know when you've added both records to Namecheap!
Then we wait for DNS to propagate and your site will be live at 
creativemindhabits.com! üéâRetryEokay how do i know which one to 
delete for name records, as I also have gmail connected on 
namecheapDO NOT delete any MX records or TXT records! Those are for 
your Gmail.
Only delete:
Look for records with these characteristics:

Type: A Record with Host @ pointing to an IP that's NOT Vercel's
Type: CNAME Record with Host www pointing to Blogger (might say 
something like ghs.google.com or blogspot.com)

Keep ALL of these (for Gmail):

MX Records (anything with "mail" or "mx")
TXT Records (for email verification)
Any records with Host like mail, smtp, imap, etc.

Can you tell me what A Records and CNAME Records you currently see? 
(Just the Host and Value for each)
Then I'll tell you exactly which ones to delete!RetryEyay it 
worksüéâüéâüéâ CONGRATULATIONS!!!

What's Next (Future Weekends)
When you're ready to continue:

Migrate more blog posts from Blogger
Add more custom pages
Tweak styling
Set up redirects from old Blogger URLs (optional)


Total time today: About 4 hours (as planned!)
You now have a fast, elegant, completely custom site that you 
control. No more WordPress bloat, no Blogger limitations. Just clean, 
beautiful content.
How do you feel? üéäRetryEokay so let's focus on tweaking styling 
todayPerfect! Let's make your site look even better.
What would you like to tweak?
Here are some areas we could work on:
Typography & Spacing:

Font sizes (headings, body text)
Line heights and paragraph spacing
Letter spacing

Colors:

Adjust the stone palette
Link colors
Button styles

Layout:

Homepage post grid spacing
Blog post layout (width, margins)
Navigation styling

Specific Pages:

Any page that still feels off?
Post pages need work?

Other Elements:

Add a footer with social links?
Newsletter signup on homepage?
Date formatting on posts?

What's bothering you most about the current design? Or what specific 
element would you like to improve first?RetryEso at first glance... 
it looks like the header on mobile blocks the content as you scroll. 
Ideally it should disappear as you scroll the page is visibleGreat 
catch! Let's make the header hide when scrolling down and reappear 
when scrolling up.
In VS Code, open src/_includes/layouts/base.njk
Find the <header> section and add a class to it:
html<header class="site-header">
Then, at the bottom of the file (right before the closing </body> 
tag), add this JavaScript:
html<script>
let lastScroll = 0;
const header = document.querySelector('.site-header');

window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
  const currentScroll = window.pageYOffset;
  
  if (currentScroll <= 0) {
    header.classList.remove('scroll-up');
    return;
  }
  
  if (currentScroll > lastScroll && 
!header.classList.contains('scroll-down')) {
    // Scrolling down
    header.classList.remove('scroll-up');
    header.classList.add('scroll-down');
  } else if (currentScroll < lastScroll && 
header.classList.contains('scroll-down')) {
    // Scrolling up
    header.classList.remove('scroll-down');
    header.classList.add('scroll-up');
  }
  
  lastScroll = currentScroll;
});
</script>
Now open src/assets/css/style.css and add these styles at the bottom:
css.site-header {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
  z-index: 100;
}

.site-header.scroll-down {
  transform: translateY(-100%);
}

.site-header.scroll-up {
  transform: translateY(0);
}
Save both files, then push:
bashgit add .
git commit -m "Add hide-on-scroll header behavior"
git push
The header will now hide when scrolling down and show when scrolling 
up! Test it on mobile when it deploys.RetryEokay it's better but when 
it disappears it removes the header "creative mind habits", also the 
entire menu"home" "about"..... feels like it takes  up alot of space 
on the home pageGood points! Let's fix both issues:

Make the header smaller/more compact
Fix the disappearing behavior so it works smoothly

In src/assets/css/style.css, find the header-related styles and 
update them:
css/* Header adjustments */
.site-header {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
  z-index: 100;
  background: #fafaf9;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #e7e5e4;
}

.site-header.scroll-down {

This makes the header significantly smaller and takes up way less 
space on mobile!RetryElet's take a step back i liked the size of 
"Creative Mind Habits" and the subtitle "Prompts, tools & tiny 
systems that keep you writing" however the menu on mobile seems too 
long, so we need a way to click on mobile so it appears instead of it 
just being there looking instrusive. On desktop it's fine cause there 
is space for it. It looks good. Home
* About
* Tools
* Creator Systems
* Prompt Vault
* NovelPerfect! Let's add a hamburger menu for mobile that hides the 
navigation behind a button.
First, update src/_includes/layouts/base.njk - find the header 
section and replace it with this:
html<header class="site-header">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="header-content">
      <div class="site-branding">
        <h1 class="site-title">
          <a href="/">Creative Mind Habits</a>
        </h1>
        <p class="site-tagline">Prompts, tools & tiny systems that 
keep you writing</p>
      </div>
      
      <button class="nav-toggle" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
        <span></span>
        <span></span>
        <span></span>
      </button>
      
      <nav class="site-nav">
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="/about/">About</a></li>
          <li><a href="/tools/">Tools</a></li>
          <li><a href="/creator-systems/">Creator Systems</a></li>
          <li><a href="/prompt-vault/">Prompt Vault</a></li>
          <li><a href="/novel/">Novel</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </div>
  </div>
</header>
Then, update your CSS - replace the entire header section in 
src/assets/css/style.css:
css/* === HEADER === */
.site-header {
  background: white;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #e7e5e4;
  box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.03);
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  z-index: 100;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}

.site-header.scroll-down {
  transform: translateY(-100%);
}

.site-header.scroll-up {
  transform: translateY(0);
}

.header-content {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 1.5rem 0;
  gap: 1rem;
  position: relative;
}

.site-title {
  font-size: 1.8rem;
  margin: 0;
  letter-spacing: -0.5px;
}

.site-title a {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #1c1917;
}

.site-tagline {
  color: #78716c;
  font-size: 0.9rem;
  font-style: italic;
  margin: 0.25rem 0 0 0;
}

/* Hamburger menu button (hidden on desktop) */
.nav-toggle {
  display: none;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 5px;
  background: none;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  padding: 8px;
  z-index: 101;
}

.nav-toggle span {
  display: block;
  width: 25px;
  height: 3px;
  background: #1c1917;
  border-radius: 3px;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

.nav-toggle.active span:nth-child(1) {
  transform: rotate(45deg) translate(7px, 7px);
}

.nav-toggle.active span:nth-child(2) {
  opacity: 0;
}

.nav-toggle.active span:nth-child(3) {
  transform: rotate(-45deg) translate(7px, -7px);
}

.site-nav ul {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1.5rem;
  list-style: none;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.site-nav a {
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 
sans-serif;
  font-size: 0.9rem;
  font-weight: 500;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #57534e;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: 1px;
  padding: 0.5rem 0;
  border-bottom: 2px solid transparent;
  transition: all 0.2s ease;
}

.site-nav a:hover {
  color: #1c1917;
  border-bottom-color: #57534e;
}
Now add mobile-specific styles - replace the mobile section:
css/* === MOBILE RESPONSIVE === */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  html {
    font-size: 15px;
  }
  
  .container {
    padding: 0 1.25rem;
  }
  
  /* Show hamburger on mobile */
  .nav-toggle {
    display: flex;
  }
  
  .header-content {
    flex-wrap: nowrap;
    padding: 1rem 0;
  }
  
  /* Hide nav by default on mobile */
  .site-nav {
    position: absolute;
    top: 100%;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    background: white;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #e7e5e4;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
    max-height: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
    transition: max-height 0.3s ease;
  }
  
  .site-nav.active {
    max-height: 400px;
  }
  
  .site-nav ul {
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 0;
    width: 100%;
    padding: 1rem 1.5rem;
  }
  
  .site-nav li {
    border-bottom: 1px solid #f5f5f4;
  }
  
  .site-nav li:last-child {
    border-bottom: none;
  }
  
  .site-nav a {
    display: block;
    padding: 0.75rem 0;
    border-bottom: none;
  }
  
  .site-main {
    padding: 2.5rem 0;
  }
  
  .posts-grid {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    gap: 1.5rem;
  }
  
  .post-single {
    padding: 2rem 1.5rem;
  }
  
  .post-title {
    font-size: 2rem;
  }
  
  h1 { font-size: 2rem; }
  h2 { font-size: 1.6rem; }
  
  .post-nav {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
Finally, add the JavaScript - at the bottom of base.njk before the 
closing </body> tag, add:
html<script>
// Mobile menu toggle
const navToggle = document.querySelector('.nav-toggle');
const siteNav = document.querySelector('.site-nav');

if (navToggle) {
  navToggle.addEventListener('click', () => {
    navToggle.classList.toggle('active');
    siteNav.classList.toggle('active');
  });
  
  // Close menu when clicking a link
  const navLinks = document.querySelectorAll('.site-nav a');
  navLinks.forEach(link => {
    link.addEventListener('click', () => {
      navToggle.classList.remove('active');
      siteNav.classList.remove('active');
    });
  });
}

// Hide header on scroll
let lastScroll = 0;
const header = document.querySelector('.site-header');

window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
  const currentScroll = window.pageYOffset;
  
  if (currentScroll <= 0) {
    header.classList.remove('scroll-up');
    return;
  }
  
  if (currentScroll > lastScroll && 
!header.classList.contains('scroll-down')) {
    header.classList.remove('scroll-up');
    header.classList.add('scroll-down');
  } else if (currentScroll < lastScroll && 
header.classList.contains('scroll-down')) {
    header.classList.remove('scroll-down');
    header.classList.add('scroll-up');
  }
  
  lastScroll = currentScroll;
});
</script>
Save and push:
bashgit add .
git commit -m "Add hamburger menu for mobile"
git push
Now on mobile you'll see a hamburger icon (‚ò∞) that opens/closes the 
menu, keeping the header clean! On desktop, the menu stays visible as 
normal.RetryEokay and what about the size of site title and 
subtitleLet's revert the site title and tagline back to the original 
larger sizes you liked!
In src/assets/css/style.css, find the .site-title and .site-tagline 
styles and update them:
css.site-title {
  font-size: 1.8rem; /* Keep the original size */
  margin: 0;
  letter-spacing: -0.5px;
}

.site-title a {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #1c1917;
}

.site-tagline {
  color: #78716c;
  font-size: 0.9rem; /* Keep the original size */
  font-style: italic;
  margin: 0.25rem 0 0 0;
}
These should already be at the right size from your original CSS! The 
hamburger menu will handle hiding the navigation on mobile, so the 
title and tagline can stay nice and prominent.
Save and push:
bashgit add src/assets/css/style.css
git commit -m "Keep original site title and tagline sizes"
git push
Perfect! Now you have:

‚úÖ Full-size title and tagline (looks great!)
‚úÖ Hidden navigation on mobile (hamburger menu)
‚úÖ Full navigation on desktop (plenty of space)

Test it when it deploys!RetryEokay can you give me everything in one 
simple copy and paste formatAbsolutely! Here's everything in one go:

1. Update src/_includes/layouts/base.njk
Find the <header> section and replace it with:
html<header class="site-header">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="header-content">
      <div class="site-branding">
        <h1 class="site-title">
          <a href="/">Creative Mind Habits</a>
        </h1>
        <p class="site-tagline">Prompts, tools & tiny systems that 
keep you writing</p>
      </div>
      
      <button class="nav-toggle" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
        <span></span>
        <span></span>
        <span></span>
      </button>
      
      <nav class="site-nav">
        <ul>

        </ul>
      </nav>
    </div>
  </div>
</header>
Then find the JavaScript at the bottom (before </body>) and replace 
with:
html<script>
// Mobile menu toggle
const navToggle = document.querySelector('.nav-toggle');
const siteNav = document.querySelector('.site-nav');

if (navToggle) {
  navToggle.addEventListener('click', () => {
    navToggle.classList.toggle('active');
    siteNav.classList.toggle('active');
  });
  
  // Close menu when clicking a link
  const navLinks = document.querySelectorAll('.site-nav a');
  navLinks.forEach(link => {
    link.addEventListener('click', () => {
      navToggle.classList.remove('active');
      siteNav.classList.remove('active');
    });
  });
}

// Hide header on scroll
let lastScroll = 0;
const header = document.querySelector('.site-header');

window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
  const currentScroll = window.pageYOffset;
  
  if (currentScroll <= 0) {
    header.classList.remove('scroll-up');
    return;
  }
  
  if (currentScroll > lastScroll && 
!header.classList.contains('scroll-down')) {
    header.classList.remove('scroll-up');
    header.classList.add('scroll-down');
  } else if (currentScroll < lastScroll && 
header.classList.contains('scroll-down')) {
    header.classList.remove('scroll-down');
    header.classList.add('scroll-up');
  }
  
  lastScroll = currentScroll;
});
</script>

Done! Copy, paste, save, push. üöÄRetryEplease create a well craft 
essay for me which is a way to introduce the new site we ust 
created... heres what i have so far... üß† Building a Thinking Studio 
in the Age of Noise
Lately I‚Äôve been asking: what does it mean to think deeply in a time 
when everything moves too fast to remember?
We live in an era of abundance ‚Äî information, opinions, frameworks, 
hacks. Yet somehow, it feels like our minds are starving. We scroll, 
we collect, we save ‚Äî but rarely digest. Most of us are running 
creative studios built for output, not understanding.
I wanted Creative Mind Habits to be something different ‚Äî a thinking 
studio.
1. The Studio as Practice
A studio isn‚Äôt just where you make things; it‚Äôs where you return to 
yourself. Painters mix colors. Musicians rehearse scales. Writers 
wrestle with silence. What all of them share is a habit of showing up 
‚Äî not to publish, but to explore.
A thinking studio works the same way. It‚Äôs a space to test ideas, 
revisit curiosities, and build a long-term relationship with 
knowledge. It‚Äôs slow, deliberate, and often private. But it‚Äôs where 
clarity begins.
2. The Noise We‚Äôre Escaping
Skim culture rewards speed over sense. Algorithms favor engagement 
over insight. In the process, thinking becomes fragmented ‚Äî little 
bursts of opinion without depth.
But every time you pause to read slowly, annotate a paragraph, or 
rewrite a thought until it makes sense, you‚Äôre rebuilding your 
capacity for depth. You‚Äôre training your attention like a muscle. 
You‚Äôre building a studio that no algorithm can optimize away.
3. The Systems That Keep You Grounded
A thinking studio isn‚Äôt built on inspiration alone. It‚Äôs built on 
systems that protect attention:
* Rituals of input: what you read, watch, and listen to with 
intention.
* Routines of reflection: how you process what stays with you.
* Tools of translation: how your notes become essays, ideas, and 
creative output.
CMH exists as a record of those systems ‚Äî the creative scaffolding 
behind a more meaningful kind of work.
4. The Point Isn‚Äôt to Think More ‚Äî It‚Äôs to Think Better
The real power of a thinking studio is focus. It‚Äôs not about 
consuming everything; it‚Äôs about consuming with purpose. Every post, 
review, and reflection here is a small act of resistance against the 
shallow pull of ‚Äúnext.‚Äù
To think better is to build better. And to build better is to live 
with more coherence.
5. Welcome to the Studio
Creative Mind Habits has always been a lab ‚Äî for writing, for 
learning, for becoming. This next chapter is about building the 
architecture of thought behind it. A studio that values slow ideas, 
deliberate creation, and the courage to keep showing up ‚Äî even when 
no one‚Äôs watching.
Because the work of thinking isn‚Äôt loud. But it lasts.This is 
beautiful and thoughtful! Let me refine it while keeping your voice 
and adding more context about the actual site migration. Here's a 
polished version:

dashboard, every algorithmic nudge toward "engagement" ‚Äî they all 
chip away at the clarity you're trying to build.
This new space is lighter. Faster. Mine. Built with intention, not 
templates.
2. The Noise We're Escaping
Skim culture rewards speed over sense. Algorithms favor engagement 
over insight. In the process, thinking becomes fragmented ‚Äî little 
bursts of opinion without depth, hot takes without reflection, 
information without understanding.
We've normalized reading headlines as if they're full articles. 
Bookmarking essays we'll never revisit. Reposting thoughts we haven't 
fully digested. We mistake exposure for learning, consumption for 
growth.

Not everything, not endlessly ‚Äî but deliberately, with care for what 
shapes your thinking.
Routines of reflection: How you process what stays with you. The 
Sunday spiral, the weekly review, the simple act of writing to 
understand rather than to publish.
Tools of translation: How your notes become essays, ideas become 
projects, curiosity becomes creative output. The systems that turn 
consumption into creation.
CMH exists as a record of those systems ‚Äî the creative scaffolding 
behind a more meaningful kind of work. The templates, dashboards, and 
reflection practices that turn messy process into grounded momentum.
This site isn't a content library. It's a working studio, shared in 
progress.
4. The Point Isn't to Think More ‚Äî It's to Think Better
The real power of a thinking studio is focus. It's not about 
consuming everything; it's about consuming with purpose. Not racing 
to "stay on top" of endless information streams, but choosing what 
deserves your sustained attention.
Every book review here is a form of digestion. Every essay is a way 
of slowing down. Every system shared is an invitation to build with 
intention, not just churn content.
To think better is to build better. And to build better is to live 
with more coherence ‚Äî between what you read and what you remember, 
what you believe and what you create, who you are and who you're 
becoming.
5. Welcome to the Studio
Creative Mind Habits has always been a lab ‚Äî for writing, for 
learning, for becoming. This next chapter is about building the 
architecture of thought behind it.
This is a studio that values:

Slow ideas over hot takes
Deliberate creation over algorithmic pressure
The courage to keep showing up, even when no one's watching
Systems that support, not surveil
Progress over polish, always

The site you're reading now was built in a weekend. Not because speed 
matters, but because starting matters more than perfecting. It's 
clean, simple, and entirely under my control. No bloat, no tracking, 
no optimization theater. Just words, systems, and space to think.
It will evolve. Pages will be added. Posts will accumulate. Systems 
will be refined. But the foundation is set: a place built for depth, 
designed for return, optimized for nothing but clarity.
Because the work of thinking isn't loud. But it lasts.

If you're here, you're probably building your own studio too ‚Äî 
whether you call it that or not. A practice of reading deeply, 
writing clearly, learning deliberately. A refusal to let speed 
replace substance.
Welcome. Let's figure it out together.

The real power of a thinking studio comes from focus. Consuming with 
purpose instead of consuming everything. Choosing what deserves 
sustained attention instead of racing to "stay on top" of endless 
information streams.
Every book review here is a form of digestion. Every essay is a way 
of slowing down. Every system shared is an invitation to build with

Building a Thinking Studio in the Age of Noise
Lately I've been asking: what does it mean to think deeply in a time 
when everything moves too fast to remember?
We live in an era of abundance ‚Äî information, opinions, frameworks, 
hacks. Yet somehow, it feels like our minds are starving. We scroll, 
we collect, we save (oh, do we save) ‚Äî but rarely digest. Most of us 
are running creative studios built for output, not understanding.
I wanted to build something different. Not just another blog. A 
thinking studio.
(And yes, I know how pretentious that sounds. Bear with me.)
1. The Studio as Practice
A studio isn't just where you make things; it's where you return to 
yourself. Painters mix colors. Musicians rehearse scales. Writers 
wrestle with silence (and occasionally their cats walking across 
keyboards).
What all of them share is a habit of showing up ‚Äî not to publish, but 
to explore.
A thinking studio works the same way. A space to test ideas, revisit 
curiosities, and build a long-term relationship with knowledge. Slow, 
deliberate, often private. Where clarity begins ‚Äî usually after the 
third cup of coffee and deleting the first draft.
That's why I rebuilt this site from the ground up. The old platform 
wasn't broken, but the architecture of your creative space matters. 
Every unnecessary plugin (why did I have seven?), every cluttered 
dashboard, every algorithmic nudge toward "engagement" chips away at 
the clarity you're trying to build.
This new space is lighter. Faster. Mine. Built in a weekend fueled by 
determination and pasta. No templates, no bloat, just intention.
2. The Noise We're Escaping
Skim culture rewards speed over sense. Algorithms favor engagement 
over insight. Thinking becomes fragmented ‚Äî little bursts of opinion 
without depth, hot takes without reflection, information without 
understanding.
We've normalized reading headlines as full articles. (Guilty.) 
Bookmarking essays we'll definitely read later. (Narrator: She did 
not.) Reposting thoughts we haven't fully digested because they 
sounded smart and we have 47 tabs open and honestly, who has time?
We mistake exposure for learning, consumption for growth.
But here's the thing: every time you pause to read slowly, annotate a 
paragraph (even just "huh, interesting"), or rewrite a thought until 
it actually makes sense, you rebuild your capacity for depth. You 
train your attention like a muscle ‚Äî and trust me, mine was severely 
out of shape.
You reclaim agency over what stays with you.
You build a studio that no algorithm can optimize away.
3. The Systems That Keep You Grounded
A thinking studio runs on systems that protect attention and make 
space for meaning. Not because systems are sexy (they're not), but 
because they're the scaffolding that keeps you from drowning in 
"productivity theater."
Rituals of input: What you read, watch, and listen to with intention. 
Deliberately choosing what shapes your thinking instead of 
doomscrolling at 2 AM wondering where your life went.
Routines of reflection: How you process what stays with you. The 
Sunday spiral, the weekly review, the simple act of writing to 
understand rather than to sound smart on the internet.
Tools of translation: How your notes become essays, ideas become 
projects, curiosity becomes creative output. Because having 4,000 
saved articles means nothing if you never revisit them. (Again, 
guilty.)
This site exists as a record of those systems ‚Äî the creative 
scaffolding behind more meaningful work. Templates, dashboards, and 
reflection practices that turn messy process into grounded momentum. 
A working studio, shared in progress. Mistakes included.
4. Thinking Better, Building Better
The real power of a thinking studio comes from focus. Consuming with 
purpose instead of consuming everything (impossible, by the way). 
Choosing what deserves sustained attention instead of racing to "stay 
on top" of endless information streams (also impossible, please stop 
trying).
Every book review here is a form of digestion. Every essay is a way 
of slowing down. Every system shared is an invitation to build with 
intention.
Think better, build better, live with more coherence ‚Äî between what 
you read and what you remember, what you believe and what you create, 
who you are and who you're becoming.
(And yes, I'm still figuring that out too. We're all just works in 
progress here.)
5. Welcome to the Studio
This has always been a lab ‚Äî for writing, for learning, for becoming. 
This next chapter builds the architecture of thought behind it.
A studio that values:

Slow ideas over hot takes
Deliberate creation over algorithmic pressure
The courage to keep showing up, even when no one's watching 
(especially then)
Systems that support, not surveil
Progress over polish, always (you should see my drafts folder)

The site you're reading now was built in a weekend. Starting matters 
more than perfecting. Clean, simple, entirely under my control. No 
bloat, no tracking, no optimization theater. Just words, systems, and 
space to think.
It will evolve. Pages will be added. Posts will accumulate. Systems 
will be refined. Typos will be fixed (eventually). But the foundation 
is set: a place built for depth, designed for return, optimized for 
nothing but clarity.
Because the work of thinking isn't loud. But it lasts.

If you're here, you're probably building your own studio too ‚Äî 
whether you call it that or not. A practice of reading deeply, 
writing clearly, learning deliberately. A refusal to let speed 
replace substance. Twenty tabs open but still chasing clarity.
Welcome. Let's figure it out together. I'll bring the coffee.

Much better! More relatable, self-aware, and human. Want me to dial 
the humor up or down?RetryEi like it but had the em dash alotYou're 
right! Let me clean up those em dashes:

Building a Thinking Studio in the Age of Noise
Lately I've been asking: what does it mean to think deeply in a time 
when everything moves too fast to remember?
We live in an era of abundance. Information, opinions, frameworks, 
hacks. Yet somehow, it feels like our minds are starving. We scroll, 
we collect, we save (oh, do we save), but rarely digest. Most of us 
are running creative studios built for output, not understanding.
I wanted to build something different. Not just another blog. A 
thinking studio.
(And yes, I know how pretentious that sounds. Bear with me.)
1. The Studio as Practice
A studio isn't just where you make things; it's where you return to 
yourself. Painters mix colors. Musicians rehearse scales. Writers 
wrestle with silence (and occasionally their cats walking across 
keyboards).
What all of them share is a habit of showing up, not to publish, but 
to explore.
A thinking studio works the same way. A space to test ideas, revisit 
curiosities, and build a long-term relationship with knowledge. Slow, 
deliberate, often private. Where clarity begins, usually after the 
third cup of coffee and deleting the first draft.
That's why I rebuilt this site from the ground up. The old platform 
wasn't broken, but the architecture of your creative space matters. 
Every unnecessary plugin (why did I have seven?), every cluttered 
dashboard, every algorithmic nudge toward "engagement" chips away at 
the clarity you're trying to build.
This new space is lighter. Faster. Mine. Built in a weekend fueled by 
determination and pasta. No templates, no bloat, just intention.
2. The Noise We're Escaping
Skim culture rewards speed over sense. Algorithms favor engagement 
over insight. Thinking becomes fragmented. Little bursts of opinion 
without depth, hot takes without reflection, informatioconst form = 
document.getElementById('cmhEmailForm');
const successMessage = document.getElementById('cmhSuccessMessage');

if (form) {
    form.addEventListener('submit', async function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        
        const name = document.getElementById('cmh-name').value;
        const email = document.getElementById('cmh-email').value;
        const scriptURL = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwVH1fU_hBU6xBS2lCz8W81YxZZLHB_bOUCiMOkjGa9294obpHfwO4jaO3BNQi9GpYD/exec';
        
        try {
            await fetch(scriptURL, {
                method: 'POST',
                body: JSON.stringify({ 
                    name: name, 
                    email: email, 
                    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
                    source: 'Creative Mind Habits - Prompt Vault'
                })
            });
            
            successMessage.style.display = 'block';
            form.reset();
            
        } catch (error) {
            alert('Something went wrong. Please email us directly.');
        }
    });
}
