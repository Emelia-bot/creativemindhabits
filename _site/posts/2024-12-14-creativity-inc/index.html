<h2 id="1.-background-and-author" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#1.-background-and-author">1. Background and Author</a></h2>
<p>Ed Catmull, a pioneer in computer graphics and animation, shares his journey from being a PhD student at the University of Utah to becoming the Chief Technical Officer at Pixar Animation Studios, which he co-founded with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter in 1986. Catmull's background in math, physics, and computer science, as well as his work under Ivan Sutherland, the &quot;father of computer graphics,&quot; provides a solid foundation for his insights into the <em>technical and creative aspects of animation and business.</em></p>

<h2 id="the-role-of-leadership" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-role-of-leadership">The Role of Leadership</a></h2>
<p>Catmull stresses that <em>leadership is crucial</em> in fostering creativity. He argues that managers should not prevent risks but make it safe for others to take them.

<h2 id="the-braintrust-and-collaborative-culture" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-braintrust-and-collaborative-culture">The Braintrust and Collaborative Culture</a></h2>
<p>One of the unique aspects of Pixar's culture is the <strong>&quot;Braintrust,&quot;</strong> a group of high-level creatives who provide constructive feedback on projects.

This culture of open feedback and trust is a cornerstone of Pixar's success.</p>
