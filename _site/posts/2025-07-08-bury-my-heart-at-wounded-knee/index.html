    <p>This review of <em>Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee</em> explores the emotional weight, historical significance, and why every history-lover should read it (even when it hurts).</p>
<h2 id="first%2C-a-warning%3A-this-book-hurts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#first%2C-a-warning%3A-this-book-hurts">First, a Warning: This Book Hurts</a></h2>
<p>If you're looking for a feel-good, underdog-wins-in-the-end kind of history book — <em>Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee</em> is not that. At all.</p>
<p>It's the kind of book that makes your chest ache. It should. And if it doesn't? Read it again. Slower.</p>
<p>Published in 1970 by <strong>Dee Brown</strong>, this landmark text shifts the historical narrative westward, far away from the colonial &quot;pioneers&quot; and toward the Indigenous nations whose lands, rights, and lives were systematically taken during the so-called expansion of the American frontier.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-book-actually-covers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-the-book-actually-covers">What the Book Actually Covers</a></h2>
<p>This is not one of those vague &quot;Native American history&quot; overviews. Brown structures the book chronologically, tribe by tribe, region by region, showing exactly how the U.S. government broke promise after promise through lies, manipulation, massacres, and forced removals.</p>
<p>Each chapter centers real people: <strong>Sitting Bull. Red Cloud. Geronimo. Cochise. Chief Joseph.</strong></p>
<p>It's not just what happened. It's <em>how</em> it was recorded, distorted, and forgotten until Brown flipped the lens.</p>
<h2 id="why-it's-so-damn-important" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-it's-so-damn-important">Why It's So Damn Important</a></h2>
<p>This book reframes American history from the perspective of those most devastated by its myth. It's one thing to vaguely know that &quot;bad stuff happened&quot; during westward expansion. It's another thing entirely to sit with the testimony, betrayal, and grief that defined generation after generation of Indigenous resistance.</p>
<p>If you've ever thought, &quot;We weren't taught this in school,&quot; you're not wrong. This book fills that silence and then some.</p>
<p>And yet, it's not written like a dry textbook. Brown, who was a librarian by trade, writes with clarity, structure, and empathy. The result? A book that's readable, powerful, and unforgettable.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-emotional-toll" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-note-on-emotional-toll">A Note on Emotional Toll</a></h2>
<p>Reading this book is heavy. It's repetitive in the worst way. It's definitely not because Brown lacks range. But the U.S. government kept repeating the same crimes.</p>
<p>Treaty made → treaty broken → violence → displacement → rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>It's not a flaw in the book. It's a reflection of historical reality. But pacing yourself while reading? Highly recommended.</p>
<h2 id="who-this-book-is-for" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#who-this-book-is-for">Who This Book Is For</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Writers and researchers interested in power, empire, and narrative control</li>
<li>Readers who want to fill the historical gaps we were never taught in school</li>
<li>Anyone ready to confront the uncomfortable truths behind &quot;manifest destiny&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not easy. But it's essential.</p>
<h2 id="what-i'm-still-thinking-about" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-i'm-still-thinking-about">What I'm Still Thinking About</a></h2>
<p>This quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What white man can say I ever stole his land or a penny of his money? Yet they say I am a thief.&quot; — Sitting Bull</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are hundreds more. That one just stuck in my throat.</p>
<p>History is not neutral. The way we tell it and who we center in that telling is everything. That's what makes <em>Bury My Heart</em> not just a book, but a reckoning.</p>

<p>This isn't casual reading. It's commitment reading. It's conscience-level reading. And it's the kind of history that leaves you different than when you started.</p>
<p>Should you read it? If you care about truth, land, justice, and the voices that history tried to erase — then yes. Immediately.</p>
